# Google-Foobar-Challenge
I saw this challenge on my Google Data Analytics Certification Course. I had to decode a binary code to get the link. I had so much fun solving this. I used python for solving all the 5 levels since I have a strong understanding of this language. 

Level 1: Solar Doomsday

Level 2: Hey, I Already Did That!

Level 3 :Doomsday Fuel

Level 4:
Bunny Prisoner Location
Bringing a Gun to a Guard Fight

Level 5: Expanding Nebula
